# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a professional-grade toolkit used to test the security of web applications.

It works as a proxy — sitting between your browser and the internet — allowing you to intercept, analyze, and manipulate web traffic.
It’s used to find vulnerabilities like:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Broken Authentication
- Logic flaws and insecure session handling

## How It Works
Burp Suite captures HTTP(S) requests sent by your browser and lets you:
- Modify or replay those requests
- Automatically scan for vulnerabilities
- Inject payloads (fuzzing)
- Perform brute-force attacks
- Map hidden areas of the website (spidering)

> This documentation focuses on Burp Suite Community Edition, which does not include the automated scanner. All testing is done manually.


## Core Tools
| Tool              | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------|
| Proxy         | Captures requests and responses between browser ↔ server   |
| Target        | Shows the structure/sitemap of the application             |
| Intruder      | Automates attacks: brute force, fuzzing, parameter testing |
| Repeater      | Manual testing: edit and resend requests                   |
| Scanner (Pro) | Automatically scans for vulnerabilities                    |
| Decoder       | Encodes/decodes Base64, URL, etc.                          |
| Comparer      | Diffs two responses or requests                            |
| Extender      | Adds plugins via Burp App Store (BApps)                    |

## Common Testing Workflows (Community Version)
Though Burp is GUI-based (not terminal), here’s how you operate each module

| Action                     | Tool        | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Enable intercept          | Proxy       | Start capturing live browser requests |
| Forward/Drop requests     | Proxy       | Let requests go through or block them |
| Send to Repeater          | Right-click | Edit and resend individual requests |
| Send to Intruder          | Right-click | Start basic brute-force/fuzzing tests |
| Observe site structure    | Target      | Map links and endpoints manually as you browse |
| Decode input              | Decoder     | Decode JWT, Base64, URL-encoded, etc. |
| Compare responses         | Comparer    | Detect subtle differences between responses |

## Burp Suite Filters
You can filter request types in the Proxy tab:
- Show only GET or POST requests
- Filter by MIME type (HTML, JSON, JavaScript)
- Highlight URLs with certain headers/cookies

## Repeater Use-Cases 

| Task         | Method |
|--------------|--------|
| Test login form | Intercept login → Send to Repeater → Modify credentials and resend|
| Check for XSS   | Inject payloads like `<script>alert(1)</script>` into input fields|
| SQL Injection   | Try `' OR '1'='1 --` in vulnerable parameters |
| IDOR Testing  | Change parameters like `user_id=1 → user_id=2` and observe response |

## Intruder Modes
Burp Intruder offers 4 attack types:
| Mode              | Use                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Sniper**        | Single payload at a time             |
| **Battering Ram** | Same payload to all positions        |
| **Pitchfork**     | Multiple payloads in parallel        |
| **Cluster Bomb**  | All combinations (nested loop style) |
Use Intruder to:
- Bruteforce login credentials
- Fuzz input fields for XSS
- Discover hidden parameters

## Smart Payloads to Try
| Type              | Payload                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| XSS               | `<script>alert(1)</script>` |
| SQL injection     | `' OR '1'='1`               |
| LFI (Local File Inclusion) | `../../etc/passwd` |
| Command Injection | `; ls -la`                  |
|IDOR	              |user_id=1 → user_id=2        |
