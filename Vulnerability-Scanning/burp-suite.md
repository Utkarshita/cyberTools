# Burp Suite
Web Vulnerability Testing Tool

## What It Does
Burp Suite is a penetration testing tool for web apps. It allows you to:
- Intercept, view, and modify HTTP/S requests and responses
- Scan for common web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, SSRF, etc.)
- Perform brute force attacks on logins or parameters
- Analyze target URLs, endpoints, and cookies
- Spider applications and map the structure
- Test for broken authentication, misconfigured sessions, and business logic flaws

## It’s Powerful
- It sits between your browser and the internet as a proxy
- You can manipulate requests in real-time
- It automates many vulnerability scans
- It integrates with tools like SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, or custom scripts

## Core Tools
| Tool              | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Proxy**         | Intercepts browser traffic (HTTP/S)                      |
| **Target**        | Shows sitemap of the scanned application                 |
| **Intruder**      | Automates payload injection (e.g., brute force, fuzzing) |
| **Repeater**      | Manually modify and resend requests                      |
| **Scanner** (Pro) | Automatically scans for vulnerabilities                  |
| **Decoder**       | Encode/decode data (Base64, URL, etc.)                   |
| **Comparer**      | Compare responses/requests                               |
| **Extender**      | Add plugins from BApp Store                              |

## Common Use Cases
- Test login pages for brute force
- Inject XSS or SQL payloads
- Find IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
- Analyze cookie security
- Map hidden API endpoints
- Capture session hijacking opportunities

## Common Commands/Actions (GUI-Based Flow)
Though Burp is GUI-based (not terminal), here’s how you operate each module
| Action            | Tool                                          | Description                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Enable Intercept  | Proxy > Intercept                             | Captures HTTP requests                        |
| Forward Request   | Proxy                                         | Send to server without modification           |
| Send to Repeater  | Right-click > “Send to Repeater”              | Modify + resend request manually              |
| Send to Intruder  | Right-click > “Send to Intruder”              | For brute-force or fuzz testing               |
| Start Spidering   | Target > Right-click > Spider                 | Crawl all linked URLs                         |
| Start Scan        | Target > Right-click > Active Scan (Pro only) | Automated vuln scan                           |
| Decode Payload    | Decoder                                       | Base64 → Text or URL → Raw                    |
| Compare Responses | Comparer                                      | Diff two responses                            |
| Add Plugin        | Extender                                      | Install BApps (like Auth Analyzer, Retire.js) |

## Burp Suite Filters
You can filter request types in the Proxy tab:
- Show only GET or POST requests
- Filter by MIME type (HTML, JSON, JavaScript)
- Highlight URLs with certain headers/cookies

## Repeater Tips
| Task          | Example                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Test login    | Modify POST request with different passwords       |
| Check for XSS | Inject `<script>alert(1)</script>` in search/query |
| Test for SQLi | Inject `' OR '1'='1` in vulnerable fields          |

## Intruder Modes
Burp Intruder offers 4 attack types:
| Mode              | Use                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Sniper**        | Single payload at a time             |
| **Battering Ram** | Same payload to all positions        |
| **Pitchfork**     | Multiple payloads in parallel        |
| **Cluster Bomb**  | All combinations (nested loop style) |
Use Intruder to:
- Bruteforce login credentials
- Fuzz input fields for XSS
- Discover hidden parameters

## Smart Payloads to Try
| Type              | Payload                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| XSS               | `<script>alert(1)</script>` |
| SQLi              | `' OR '1'='1`               |
| LFI               | `../../etc/passwd`          |
| Command Injection | `; ls -la`                  |
