# Burp Suite

Burp Suite is a professional-grade toolkit used to test the security of web applications.

It works as a proxy — sitting between your browser and the internet — allowing you to intercept, analyze, and manipulate web traffic.
It’s used to find vulnerabilities like:
- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Broken Authentication
- Logic flaws and insecure session handling

## How It Works
Burp Suite captures HTTP(S) requests sent by your browser and lets you:
- Modify or replay those requests
- Automatically scan for vulnerabilities
- Inject payloads (fuzzing)
- Perform brute-force attacks
- Map hidden areas of the website (spidering)


## Core Tools
| Tool              | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------|
| Proxy         | Captures requests and responses between browser ↔ server   |
| Target        | Shows the structure/sitemap of the application             |
| Intruder      | Automates attacks: brute force, fuzzing, parameter testing |
| Repeater      | Manual testing: edit and resend requests                   |
| Scanner (Pro) | Automatically scans for vulnerabilities                    |
| Decoder       | Encodes/decodes Base64, URL, etc.                          |
| Comparer      | Diffs two responses or requests                            |
| Extender      | Adds plugins via Burp App Store (BApps)                    |


## Common Commands/Actions (GUI-Based Flow)
Though Burp is GUI-based (not terminal), here’s how you operate each module
| Action               | Tool                               | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable Intercept** | Proxy → Intercept                  | Captures requests sent by your browser      |
| **Forward Request**  | Proxy                              | Sends the request to server (without edits) |
| **Send to Repeater** | Right-click request                | Manually modify & resend                    |
| **Send to Intruder** | Right-click request                | For brute-force or fuzzing                  |
| **Spider Target**    | Target → Right-click → Spider      | Crawls app structure                        |
| **Start Scan**       | Target → Right-click → Active Scan | (Pro only) Auto vulnerability scanning      |
| **Decode Payload**   | Decoder                            | Converts encoded data                       |
| **Compare Results**  | Comparer                           | See diffs between server responses          |
| **Add Plugin**       | Extender                           | Install from BApp Store (like Retire.js)    |


## Burp Suite Filters
You can filter request types in the Proxy tab:
- Show only GET or POST requests
- Filter by MIME type (HTML, JSON, JavaScript)
- Highlight URLs with certain headers/cookies

## Repeater Tips
| Task          | Example                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Test login    | Modify POST request with different passwords       |
| Check for XSS | Inject `<script>alert(1)</script>` in search/query |
| Test for SQLi | Inject `' OR '1'='1` in vulnerable fields          |

## Intruder Modes
Burp Intruder offers 4 attack types:
| Mode              | Use                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Sniper**        | Single payload at a time             |
| **Battering Ram** | Same payload to all positions        |
| **Pitchfork**     | Multiple payloads in parallel        |
| **Cluster Bomb**  | All combinations (nested loop style) |
Use Intruder to:
- Bruteforce login credentials
- Fuzz input fields for XSS
- Discover hidden parameters

## Smart Payloads to Try
| Type              | Payload                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| XSS               | `<script>alert(1)</script>` |
| SQL injection     | `' OR '1'='1`               |
| LFI (Local File Inclusion) | `../../etc/passwd` |
| Command Injection | `; ls -la`                  |
|IDOR	              |user_id=1 → user_id=2        |
