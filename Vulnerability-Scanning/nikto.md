# Nikto – Web Server

Nikto scans web servers to detect:
- Dangerous or misconfigured files (e.g., /admin/, /test.cgi)
- Outdated software versions
- Default installations and sample files left after installations (e.g., sample pages)
- Known vulnerabilities (based on a large plugin database)
- It is fast, free, and a staple in beginner-to-advanced pentesting toolkits.

## How It Works
Nikto sends many types of HTTP requests to the target web server and looks at the responses. It checks:
- Server banners (for version info)
- Responses to dangerous paths (like /cgi-bin/)
- Signs of SQL injection or file upload vulnerabilities
- Known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)


## Basic Syntax
```bash
nikto -h <target>
```
-h specifies the host or URL to scan.

## Scan Options
| **Command**  | **Description**   | **Example**           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `-h`         | Target hostname/IP/URL    | `nikto -h http://example.com`    |
| `-p`         | Specify port | `nikto -h example.com -p 8080`    |
| `-ssl`       | Force SSL (HTTPS)   | `nikto -h example.com -ssl`  |
| `-Tuning`    | Choose what kind of tests to run (0-9, x) | `nikto -h example.com -Tuning 9`   |
| `-Display`   | Customize output verbosity  | `nikto -h example.com -Display V` |
| `-output`    | Save scan result to a file  | `nikto -h example.com -o result.txt`  |
| `-Format`    | Set output format (`txt`, `csv`, `xml`, `html`) | `-F txt` |
| `-evasion`   | Use evasion techniques | `nikto -h example.com -evasion 1`  |
| `-useragent` | Set custom User-Agent  | `nikto -h example.com -useragent "Mozilla/5.0"` |
| `-Cgidirs`   | Scan specific CGI directories  | `-Cgidirs /cgi-bin/`    |
| `-mutate`    | Try additional checks like guessing subdomains  | `-mutate 1`   |
| `-nossl`     | Skip SSL even if HTTPS detected                 | `-nossl`   |
| `-no404`     | Skip 404 check optimization                     | `-no404`   |
| `-timeout`   | Set timeout for each request                    | `-timeout 10` |
| `-id`        | Provide HTTP Auth creds (user\:pass)            | `-id admin:admin` |

##  Tuning (Custom Tests with -Tuning)
Let’s you customize what kind of vulnerabilities you want to test.
| Number | Test Type              |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 0      | File Upload            |
| 1      | Interesting Files      |
| 2      | Misconfigurations      |
| 3      | Information Disclosure |
| 4      | Injection              |
| 5      | Remote File Retrieval  |
| 6      | Denial of Service      |
| 7      | Remote Execution       |
| 8      | Command Execution      |
| 9      | SQL Injection          |
| x      | All tests              |
Example: Only scan for SQLi and File Uploads:
```bash
nikto -h example.com -Tuning 0,9
```

## Output Formats
Nikto can save your scan results in different formats:
| Format     | Command                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Plain Text | `-F txt -o report.txt`   |
| HTML       | `-F html -o report.html` |
| CSV        | `-F csv -o report.csv`   |
| XML        | `-F xml -o report.xml`   |


## Examples
1. Web scan
```bash
nikto -h http://192.168.1.10
```
2. HTTPS Port Scan
```bash
nikto -h 192.168.1.10 -p 443 -ssl
```
3. Output to File in Text
```bash
nikto -h example.com -o result.txt -F txt
```
4. Custom User-Agent
```bash
nikto -h example.com -useragent "MyScanBot"
```
5. Use Auth (Basic HTTP Auth)
```bash
nikto -h example.com -id admin:password123
```
6. Scan for CGI Directories
```bash
nikto -h example.com -Cgidirs /cgi-bin/
```

## Advantages
- Fast scanning
- Detects many known web vulnerabilities
- Easy to use
- Supports SSL, proxy, and authentication
- Output in multiple formats

## Limitations
- Not stealthy – can be easily detected in logs
- Limited evasion techniques
- Can produce false positives
- No advanced logic like Burp Suite Pro or commercial scanners

## When to Use Nikto?
- Scanning web apps in local labs or internal networks
- Learning vulnerability scanning basics
- Making simple reports for academic or project work
- As a first step before deeper testing with Burp Suite
